# COSC_4351
Welcome to COSC 4351 Team Project for Team 4.

Team Project for Dr. Hilford's COSC 4351 Class.

This semester's Team Project is an international online database system to be used 
to store, manage, visualize, and query EVAR (EndoVascular Aneurysm Repair) 
data (in the form of medical images), metadata, segmentations
(2D or 3D reconstruction of the "raw" medical images), 
CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) simulations, etc.
It will become the largest such system in the world.
